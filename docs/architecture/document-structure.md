# Document Structure
This architecture document is designed for modular consumption and can be sharded into focused components:

- **Core Architecture** (this document): High-level system design and integration patterns
- **Technology Stack**: Detailed technology choices and rationale → `architecture/tech-stack.md`
- **Frontend Architecture**: Component organization and data flow → `architecture/frontend.md`
- **API Structure**: Backend endpoints and communication patterns → `architecture/api.md`
- **Command System**: Keyboard-first interface implementation → `architecture/commands.md`
- **Future Considerations**: Scalability and enhancement roadmap → `architecture/future.md`
