- `*doc architecture/tech-stack.md` - Load technology stack details
- `*doc architecture/frontend.md` - Load frontend architecture specifics
- `*doc architecture/api.md` - Load API structure and endpoints
- `*doc architecture/commands.md` - Load command system implementation
- `*doc architecture/future.md` - Load future considerations and roadmap
