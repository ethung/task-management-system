# Story 1.3: Core Task Management System

## Status
accepted

## Story
**As a** user of the productivity application,
**I want** a comprehensive task management system with CRUD operations, project organization, and multiple view options,
**so that** I can effectively create, organize, and track my tasks across different time horizons while maintaining clear project structure and efficient task discovery.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create tasks with rich information (title, description, due date, priority, project assignment)
2. Tasks support Markdown formatting in descriptions and comprehensive metadata
3. Tasks can be edited, updated, and deleted with proper validation and error handling
4. Tasks can be organized into projects with hierarchical relationships
5. Multiple tags can be applied to tasks for flexible categorization and filtering
6. Basic search functionality works across all task content with quick results
7. Daily view displays today's tasks with "Big 3" priority selection capability
8. Weekly view shows tasks organized by day with drag-and-drop functionality
9. Monthly view provides high-level overview of tasks and project deadlines
10. Task status can be updated (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
11. Task filtering works by project, tags, priority, status, and date ranges
12. System provides responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Search and Filtering Requirements
**Search Functionality** [Source: docs/product-brief/detailed-functional-requirements.md#universal-search]:
- Full-text search across task titles, descriptions, and project names
- Search autocomplete and suggestions based on user history
- Search results ranked by relevance and recency
- Support for keyword matching and phrase queries
- Search results load in under 2 seconds
- Filter integration with search for refined results

**Filtering Capabilities**:
- Multi-criteria filtering (project, tags, priority, status, date ranges)
- Saved filter combinations for quick access
- Filter state persistence across browser sessions
- Visual filter indicators showing active filters
- Clear all filters and reset functionality

### Performance Requirements
**Response Time Targets** [Source: docs/product-brief/testing-strategy.md#performance-benchmarks]:
- Task list loading: â‰¤500ms for 100+ tasks
- Search results: â‰¤2s for full-text search across all content
- View switching: â‰¤200ms for smooth user experience
- Task status updates: â‰¤100ms for immediate feedback
- Database queries: â‰¤100ms average response time

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Implement pagination for large task lists (50 tasks per page)
- Use React Query for intelligent caching and background updates
- Implement optimistic updates for task status changes
- Database indexing for search and filtering performance
- Lazy loading for task descriptions and metadata

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/product-brief/testing-strategy.md#unit-testing-standards]:
- Minimum 80% code coverage for task management modules
- Unit tests for all business logic and utility functions
- Integration tests for database operations and API endpoints
- Component tests using React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests for complete task management workflows

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Task creation with all metadata fields and validation
2. Task editing and update operations with optimistic updates
3. Project assignment and task organization workflows
4. Search and filtering across various criteria and combinations
5. View switching and data persistence across different interfaces
6. Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
7. Accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Security and Validation
**Input Validation** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#application-security]:
- Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through content sanitization
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**Data Security**:
- User data isolation ensuring users only access their own tasks
- Secure API endpoints with JWT token validation
- Rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
- Audit logging for task operations and data changes

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** [Source: docs/product-brief/detailed-functional-requirements.md#accessibility]:
- Keyboard navigation support for all task management functions
- Screen reader compatibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support for visual accessibility
- Focus management for modal dialogs and complex interactions
- Alternative text for all visual indicators and icons

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Task service functions, validation schemas, utility.
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations, API endpoints, task workflows
- **Component Tests**: UI components with user interactions and state management
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete task management workflows across different views

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Task CRUD operations with comprehensive validation and error handling
2. Project-based task organization and filtering workflows
3. Search functionality with various query types and result ranking
4. Multi-view task display (daily, weekly, monthly) with responsive design
5. Tag management and multi-tag filtering capabilities
6. Task status updates with optimistic UI updates and error recovery
7. Mobile task management workflows with touch interactions
8. Accessibility testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Success Criteria
- All task management features functional with proper validation
- Search and filtering operations complete in under 2 seconds
- Responsive design works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- All tests pass with minimum 80% coverage
- Performance benchmarks met for task loading and view switching
- Accessibility compliance validated with automated and manual testing

### Special Testing Considerations
- Test with large datasets (1000+ tasks) for performance validation
- Validate concurrent user operations and optimistic update conflicts
- Test offline functionality and data synchronization when connectivity returns
- Verify markdown rendering security and XSS prevention
- Test deep linking and URL state management for shareable task views
