# Story 1.4: Weekly Planning & Reflection System

## Status
accepted

## Story
**As a** user of the productivity application,
**I want** a comprehensive weekly planning and reflection system with prompts, intention setting, and progress tracking,
**so that** I can effectively plan my weeks, break down goals into daily "Big 3" tasks, conduct meaningful weekly reflections, and track my progress week-over-week to maintain focus and achieve my career objectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Weekly planning prompts appear automatically and guide users through intention setting for the upcoming week
2. Users can break down weekly goals into daily "Big 3" priority tasks with proper scheduling
3. Weekly reflection workflow captures what went well, areas for improvement, and goals for next week
4. Progress tracking provides week-over-week insights with visual progress indicators
5. Weekly planning interface supports Markdown input for rich goal descriptions and notes
6. Weekly reflections are stored and accessible for historical review and pattern identification
7. System remembers user preferences for planning day/time and sends gentle reminders
8. Integration with existing task management system to automatically populate relevant tasks
9. Weekly reflection data can be exported for performance reviews and career development discussions
10. Mobile-responsive design ensures planning and reflection can happen on any device
11. **NEW**: Users can create/edit goals, plans, and tasks for any past or future date (not limited to current week)
12. **NEW**: System maintains comprehensive version history for all planning entities (goals, plans, tasks, reflections)
13. **NEW**: Users can undo/revert any change with a single click, accessing previous versions instantly
14. **NEW**: Users can view detailed change history and select specific versions to restore from timeline view
