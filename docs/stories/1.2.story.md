## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the development environment and foundational project structure. The authentication system builds upon this foundation and provides the security layer for all subsequent user features.

### Technology Stack and Authentication Architecture
**Authentication Framework** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#authentication-and-authorization]:
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for secure web authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API access and session management
- Secure token storage with automatic refresh capabilities
- Multi-factor authentication support for enhanced security (future enhancement)

**Security Standards** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#data-security]:
- Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- TLS 1.3 for all client-server communication
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Rate limiting implementation for authentication endpoints

### Database Schema and Models
**Users Table Structure** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#database-schema-design]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    profile JSONB,
    preferences JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Supporting Tables**:
- Email verification tokens with expiration timestamps
- Password reset tokens with secure generation and expiration
- Failed login attempts tracking for security monitoring
- User sessions for active session management

### Email Service Integration
**Email Templates and Delivery** [Source: technical requirements]:
- Email verification template with secure token links
- Password reset email template with time-limited reset links
- Welcome email template for successful registration
- Account deletion confirmation email
- Email service integration (Resend, SendGrid, or similar)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/product-brief/testing-strategy.md#unit-testing-standards]:
- Minimum 80% code coverage for authentication modules
- Unit tests for all authentication service functions
- Integration tests for complete authentication flows
- Security testing for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Performance testing for authentication endpoint response times

**Test File Organization**:
- Authentication service tests: `lib/auth/__tests__/`
- Component tests: `components/auth/__tests__/`
- API endpoint tests: `app/api/auth/__tests__/`
- End-to-end tests: `__tests__/e2e/auth/`

### Error Handling and User Experience
**Error Handling Standards**:
- Consistent error message format across all auth endpoints
- User-friendly error messages without exposing security details
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging and security monitoring

**User Experience Requirements**:
- Loading states for all authentication operations
- Clear feedback for successful operations
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all auth forms
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop authentication flows

### Configuration and Environment Variables
**Required Environment Variables**:
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT token signing
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` - Default JWT expiration time
- `EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY` - Email service authentication
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` - Sender email address for verification emails
- `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS` - Salt rounds for password hashing
- `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` - Maximum failed login attempts
- `ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT_DURATION` - Lockout duration in minutes

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Authentication service functions, password validation, JWT utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Registration flow, login flow, password reset flow
- **Security Tests**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, authentication bypass attempts
- **Performance Tests**: Authentication endpoint response times under load

### Key Test Scenarios
1. User registration with valid and invalid email formats
2. Password strength validation with various password combinations
3. Email verification flow with valid and expired tokens
4. Login attempts with correct and incorrect credentials
5. Failed login attempt tracking and account lockout
6. Session management and token refresh functionality
7. Password reset flow with valid and invalid tokens
8. Profile update operations with authorization validation

### Success Criteria
- All authentication flows complete successfully
- Security requirements met with no critical vulnerabilities
- Response times under 2 seconds for all authentication operations
- Email delivery successful for verification and reset flows
- Account lockout and security monitoring functional
- All tests pass with minimum 80% coverage

### Special Testing Considerations
- Test email verification with expired and invalid tokens
- Validate rate limiting effectiveness for brute force prevention
- Test concurrent login attempts and session management
- Verify GDPR compliance for account deletion and data export
- Test cross-browser compatibility for authentication forms
