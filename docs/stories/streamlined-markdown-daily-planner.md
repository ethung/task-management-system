## Story 1: Live Markdown Rendering Interface

### User Story
**As a** daily planner user
**I want** to type in markdown and see it rendered live without toggling between edit and preview modes
**So that** I can focus on content creation with immediate visual feedback and maintain my writing flow

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ **AC1**: When I type markdown syntax (headers, lists, bold, italic), it renders immediately with existing typography styling
✅ **AC2**: I can position my cursor anywhere in the text and continue editing without mode switching
✅ **AC3**: All existing markdown features (headers, lists, links, code blocks) work in live mode
✅ **AC4**: Typography and styling match the current preview mode exactly
✅ **AC5**: Performance remains smooth while typing (no lag or stuttering)

### Technical Implementation
- Remove edit/preview toggle component from DailyView
- Implement `LiveMarkdownEditor` component using existing markdown parser
- Integrate with current typography system and CSS classes
- Use debounced rendering (300ms) for performance optimization
- Maintain existing keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

### Testing Requirements

## Story 2: Seamless Autosave System with Offline Support

### User Story
**As a** daily planner user
**I want** my content to save automatically without manual save actions
**So that** I never lose my work and can focus purely on writing without interruption

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ **AC1**: Content automatically saves 2 seconds after I stop typing
✅ **AC2**: All save buttons, save controls, and save prompts are removed from the interface
✅ **AC3**: I can see a subtle, non-intrusive indicator when content is being saved
✅ **AC4**: When working offline, I see a minimal notification in the same location indicating "Working offline - changes saved locally"
✅ **AC5**: When connection is restored, the offline notification updates to show sync progress
✅ **AC6**: If save fails, I get a minimal error notification with retry option
✅ **AC7**: Local backup ensures no data loss if network fails

### Technical Implementation
- Remove all existing save buttons and manual save controls
- Implement debounced autosave (2000ms delay) using existing API endpoints
- Add local storage backup for offline scenarios
- Create unified status indicator component with three states:
  - **Online + Saved**: Subtle checkmark or "Saved" text (brief display)
  - **Offline**: "Working offline - changes saved locally" (persistent display)
  - **Syncing**: "Syncing changes..." (when connection restored)
- Implement network status detection using `navigator.onLine` and connectivity testing
- Queue offline changes for automatic sync when connection restored
- Integrate with existing error handling patterns

### Status Indicator Design
- **Location**: Fixed position (top-right corner or bottom of writing area)
- **Styling**: Minimal, non-intrusive design matching existing UI patterns
- **Behavior**:
  - Online saves: Show briefly (2-3 seconds) then fade
  - Offline mode: Persist until connection restored
  - Error states: Show with retry option

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for autosave functionality and status indicator
- Integration tests with existing API endpoints
- Network connectivity simulation tests (online/offline transitions)
- Offline mode and sync queue functionality tests
- Local storage persistence tests
- Error handling and recovery tests
- User experience tests for status indicator visibility and clarity

### Dependencies

- Existing save API endpoints and data models
- Current error handling system
- Network connectivity detection utilities

### Definition of Done
- [x] Autosave works reliably across all scenarios
- [x] All manual save controls removed
- [x] Offline detection and notification works seamlessly
- [x] Status indicator provides clear feedback for all states
- [x] Offline changes sync automatically when connection restored
- [x] Local backup prevents data loss
- [x] Error handling maintains existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

- Implemented network status detection with online/offline event listeners
- Created comprehensive status indicator system with visual feedback

#### Completion Notes
- Autosave triggers 2 seconds after user stops typing
- Local storage automatically backs up changes when offline
- Status indicator shows save state (saving, saved, offline, error)
- Network changes are automatically detected and handled
- Failed saves are retried and queued for later sync

#### Change Log
- Integrated autosave into StreamlinedDailyPlanner component
- Removed manual save controls from interface
- Added floating status indicator with comprehensive state management

## Epic Integration & Architecture Notes

### Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1**: Implement Story 1 (live rendering) to establish new editor foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Story 2 (autosave) to remove save controls
3. **Phase 3**: Implement Story 3 (minimal UI) to complete distraction-free experience

### Cross-Story Dependencies
1. **Story 1 → Story 2**: Live markdown rendering component will integrate with autosave functionality
2. **Story 2 → Story 3**: Autosave system works with minimal UI (no save status indicators)
3. **Story 1 & 3**: Combined create the live-rendering, minimal writing interface

### Existing System Preservation
- **Daily Task Management**: DailyView component and task functionality remain unchanged
- **Authentication**: All existing auth patterns and user session management preserved
- **Data Models**: Daily planning data structure and API endpoints unchanged
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhanced to work with new minimal layout

### Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing `useDebounce`, `useLocalStorage` hooks
- **Performance**: Debounced rendering (300ms) and autosave (2000ms) to prevent performance issues
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support maintained, keyboard navigation enhanced
- **Error Handling**: Follow existing patterns with minimal, non-intrusive error notifications

### Quality Assurance Requirements
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing daily planner and task management features remain functional
- **Performance Testing**: Validate smooth typing experience during live rendering and autosave
- **Accessibility Testing**: Confirm keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Verify responsive behavior and touch interaction on mobile devices

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flags for each story to enable quick rollback
- Database migration scripts (if needed) are reversible
- Component versioning for gradual deployment

---

## Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (none needed)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (using current typography)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (removing complexity)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk**: Users losing unsaved work during autosave implementation
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust debounced autosave with local backup storage and offline support
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flags to revert to edit/preview mode if needed

## Epic Definition of Done
- [x] All three stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing daily planner functionality verified through testing
- [x] Markdown rendering working correctly with live updates
- [x] Autosave functionality tested and reliable with offline support
- [x] Interface is clean, distraction-free, and maximizes writing focus
- [x] No regression in existing daily planning features
- [x] Cross-device compatibility maintained
- [x] Performance standards met or exceeded
