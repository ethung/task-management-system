## Status
accepted

## Story
**As a** busy leader or individual contributor using the productivity application,
**I want** a sophisticated base AI agent with deep productivity expertise that acts as my trusted partner, providing measured guidance based on proven frameworks (GTD, Full Focus), smart autocomplete, pattern recognition, and orchestration of specialized agents,
**so that** I can leverage expert productivity knowledge, never miss important patterns in my work, receive proactive but measured assistance, and seamlessly hand off complex needs to specialized agents while maintaining continuity of context and relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Expert Productivity Knowledge**: Base agent demonstrates deep understanding of GTD (David Allen), Full Focus (Michael Hyatt), and other proven productivity frameworks, applying principles contextually
2. **Measured Expert Responses**: Agent provides thoughtful, measured guidance without being verbose or overly optimistic, matching the communication style of experienced productivity consultants
3. **CRUD Actions with Confirmations**: Agent can create, read, update, and delete any plan, goal, or task entity with appropriate confirmation workflows for destructive actions
4. **Smart Autocomplete**: Intelligent text completion for writing and planning based on user patterns, productivity principles, and contextual awareness
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced analysis of repeated tasks, time estimation accuracy, productivity cycles, and behavior patterns with proactive suggestions
6. **Proactive Plan Adjustment**: Agent automatically identifies when users get busy and suggests intelligent priority adjustments and plan modifications
7. **Agent Orchestration**: Base agent can seamlessly hand off complex requests to specialized agents (resume expert, career coach) while maintaining context
8. **Integration with Task Management**: Full CRUD integration with existing task management system with intelligent suggestions and automation
9. **Historical Data Intelligence**: Smart suggestions based on comprehensive analysis of user's historical productivity data and patterns
10. **Confirmation Workflows**: Robust confirmation systems for all destructive actions (deletions, major changes) with clear undo mechanisms
11. **Framework Integration**: Active application of productivity framework principles in suggestions, with ability to switch between frameworks based on user preference
12. **Expert Persona**: Agent maintains identity as experienced productivity expert helping busy professionals, not as generic AI assistant
