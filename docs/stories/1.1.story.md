## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, establishing the foundation for all subsequent development.

### Technology Stack and Architecture
**Framework and Runtime** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#frontend-technology-stack]:
- Next.js 15+ with App Router for full-stack React development
- React 19+ for UI components with latest features
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Node.js 20+ for backend runtime

**Styling and UI** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#frontend-technology-stack]:
- Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling approach
- Shadcn/UI components for accessible, customizable components with Tailwind CSS integration
- Custom design system with consistent tokens

**State Management** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#frontend-technology-stack]:
- Zustand for lightweight client state management
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state and caching

**Database and Backend** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#database-architecture]:
- PostgreSQL 15+ as primary database with JSONB support
- Express.js with TypeScript for API layer
- Redis for caching and session management

**Development Tools** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#frontend-technology-stack]:
- Vite for fast development builds
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing

### Project Structure Standards
**Directory Organization** [Source: existing package.json and Next.js 15 conventions]:
```
plannerproject/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
├── components/            # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                   # Utilities, types, and shared logic
├── public/               # Static assets
├── styles/               # Global styles and Tailwind config
├── __tests__/            # Test files and utilities
├── docs/                 # Project documentation
└── scripts/              # Build and deployment scripts
```

**Database Schema Foundation** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#database-schema-design]:
- Users table with UUID primary keys and JSONB for flexible profiles
- Projects table for task organization
- Tasks table with rich metadata and relationships
- Proper indexing for search and performance

### Security and Performance Requirements
**Security Standards** [Source: docs/product-brief/technical-architecture-design.md#security-architecture]:
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Content Security Policy headers
- Secure environment variable management
- Database connection security with SSL

**Performance Requirements** [Source: docs/product-brief/testing-strategy.md#quality-gates]:
- Build time optimization with Turbopack
- Response times under 2 seconds for all user actions
- Mobile performance score >90
- Code splitting and lazy loading implementation

### Testing Standards
**Testing Approach** [Source: docs/product-brief/testing-strategy.md#unit-testing-standards]:
- Minimum 80% code coverage for all new features
- Jest for unit testing with React Testing Library
- Test structure using Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Fast tests (<1s execution time per test)

**Test File Organization**:
- Test files co-located with components: `component.test.tsx`
- Utility tests in `__tests__/` directory
- Integration tests in separate `__tests__/integration/` folder

### Configuration Management
**Environment Variables**:
- Database connection strings
- API keys for external services
- Application secrets and JWT tokens
- Feature flags for development

**Build Configuration**:
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Path mapping for clean imports
- Bundle optimization and tree shaking
- Source map generation for debugging

## Testing

### Required Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: All utility functions and business logic components
- **Component Tests**: UI components with React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **Build Tests**: Validate successful builds and deployments

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Development environment setup and configuration validation
2. Build pipeline execution and output verification
3. Shadcn/UI component rendering and basic interactions
4. Database connection and basic CRUD operations
5. Environment variable loading and validation
6. Code quality tools execution (linting, formatting)

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass with 80% coverage minimum
- Build completes without errors or warnings
- Development server starts successfully
- Database migrations run without issues
- Code quality checks pass in CI/CD pipeline

### Special Testing Considerations
- Mock external service dependencies during testing
- Test database isolation between test runs
- Validate cross-browser compatibility for core functionality
- Performance testing for build times and bundle sizes
